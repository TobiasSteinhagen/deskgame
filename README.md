Every 🐸 sent a picture of his/her desk to coach Jess.

We will guess, on a regular basis, after the coach posted a random desk picture whose desk this is.

1. If you have a guess, give a ✅ in zoom
2. Write the name of the person in the Slack thread, regarding this picture

   ------- DON'T SEND IT YET 🤓---------

3. Coach will give us a countdwon and after the countdown, hit the hell out of the send button in Slack and let the fun begin 🔥
